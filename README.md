🚀 Live Demo: [View Interactive Dashboard](agri_sales_dashboard.html)

🌟 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a full data analytics workflow. I started with a highly inconsistent agricultural sales dataset (100+ records) and transformed it into a professional dashboard that provides actionable business insights.

🛠️ Problems I Solved (Data Cleaning)

The raw data was "noisy" and full of errors. I performed the following:

Standardization: Unified naming for Regions (e.g., "delta" to "Delta") and Employees.

Error Correction: Identified and fixed a massive entry error (1,000,000 EGP outlier).

Date Normalization: Converted multiple date formats (DD-MM-YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY) into a single standard.

Handling Missing Values: Used logical formulas to recover missing Unit Price and Total Sales values.

Trend Analysis: Identified a 29% decline in profit since March, requiring strategic intervention in the "Seeds" category.

Microsoft Excel: Power Query, Pivot Tables, and Advanced Formulas (SUMIFS, IF).
